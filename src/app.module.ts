//----------------------------------------------------------------
//The root module of the application.
//----------------------------------------------------------------
//Modules are executed within their own scope, not in the global 
//scope; this means that variables, functions, classes, etc. declared 
//in a module are not visible outside the module unless they are explicitly 
//exported using one of the export forms. Conversely, to consume a variable, 
//function, class, interface, etc. exported from a different module, 
//it has to be imported using one of the import forms.
//Modules are declarative; the relationships between modules are specified in terms of imports and exports at the file level.
//Modules import one another using a module loader. At runtime the module loader is responsible for locating and 
//executing all dependencies of a module before executing it. Well-known module loaders used in JavaScript are Node.jsâ€™s loader for 
//CommonJS modules and the RequireJS loader for AMD modules in Web applications.
//In TypeScript, just as in ECMAScript 2015, any file containing a top-level import or export is considered a module. 
//Conversely, a file without any top-level import or export declarations is treated as a script whose contents are available in 
//the global scope (and therefore to modules as well).
